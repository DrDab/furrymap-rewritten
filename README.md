# furrymap-rewritten
A WIP project to revive FurryMap.net after it borked

# But why?
In May of 2019, furrymap.net was indefinitely shut down by it's original operator, with the site presenting the farewell page shown below:

<b>What happened?</b><br>
After running this website for 11 years, the software stack used to run this website became too old to run. With the end of support for Ubuntu 14.04, it was no longer safe to run it. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Why have you not updated it to a newer version?</b><br>
I already tried running it with updated versions, but libraries and frameworks used to create this website are no longer updated. Essentially I would've had to rewrite it, to make it work. But the codebase is old and not worth the effort. The internet has changed a lot in the last 11 years.
</p>
<p>
<b>Didn't you work on a completely new version?</b><br>
Yes, but it was never finished. Writing websites like this takes a lot of time, even if they are small. When I find the time, I might finish it and restart this website.
</p>
<p>
<b>Can I donate to get the website running again?</b><br>
While I appreciate the gesture, this is not something that can be solved with money. Furrymap has always been free of charge, paid out of my own pocket. It was my part to support the community and help others find likeminded people.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is there an alternative?</b><br>
You might want to have a look at Howlr. 
</p>
<p>
<b>How can I contact you?</b><br>
You can send an email to webmaster @ this domain or write me on <a href="https://twitter.com/furrymap">Twitter</a>.

This project aims to recreate the experience of furrymap.net for future users.
